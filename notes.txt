Usage:
1. make sites_conf/ file and add libraries to file
2. make js file and put it in import_js, include name in conf file
3. make site html file, everything between the <body></body> tags go here
4. make python methods to be called over rpc, put them in file in import_py, use same name as site


Every transaction should include the 'id', which is the clients place in the clients list
The initial response from the server to opening a connection should include the clients place in the list

Including JS scripts in the template:
- app receives a site request
- gets the app name from path
- looks for a config file with name that matches path
- config file has a list of js files
- in the includes folder there are class files with matching file names
- these files get included in the template

Running Python scripts from JS client:
- websocket receives json string
- string gets parsed
- python classes from imports_py are imported at top of doople.py
- method name in json message must match imported class/function name
- method/function is called from its string name

Running client JS scripts from server:
- any script in the imports_py should be able to call SendJson()
- the client takes the message string and runs the matching function


- template the index page based on the site requested
- dynamic function call
- Index page needs to import declared scripts, parse json, run methods from strings, init.
- Node client needs to do the same, plus packaging, init.
- Server needs to import declared scripts, parse json, run methods from strings, packaged.
- CouchDB
- The node client can spawn children with cluster.fork. It can detect the CPU count. So a cluster Boolean should be sent to the node client (false means don't fork). And if it does fork the master will have to know how to apportion the tasks.
